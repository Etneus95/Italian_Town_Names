# Italian Town Names
An enhanced Italian Town Names NewGRF for OpenTTD

=== Description ===

This NewGRF features the ~1300 most populated cities and towns of Italy.

Selection probability is based upon the real population of the city.

To support variety in the selection and to avoid the largest cities being selected too frequently, the final weights were obtained by applying a sqrt(x) function to the populations.
